# Tip-Prediction-Using-Fuzzy-Logic-Controller-Fuzzy-Inference-System

## Problem Statement
The goal is to create a Fuzzy Control System which models how you might choose to tip at a restaurant. When tipping, you consider the Service and Food Quality, rated between 0 and 10. You use this to leave a tip of between 0 and 30%.

## Tasks Performed
1. Setting up input variables: Service and Food Quality.
2. Setting up output variables: Tip.
3. Setting up the rule base.
4. Testing the model against several different test cases.

## Conclusion
Although Fuzzy Logic in artificial intelligence helps to mimic human reasoning, these systems need expert guidance to be built. This lets you rely on the experience of experts who have a better understanding of the system. Fuzzy Logic can also be used for enhancing the execution of algorithms. IBM Watson uses Fuzzy Logic and fuzzy semantics.

## Future Scope
Fuzzy logic allows for the inclusion of vague human assessments in computing problems. Also, it provides an effective means for conflict resolution of multiple criteria and better assessment of options. New computing methods based on fuzzy logic can be used in the development of intelligent systems for decision making, identification, pattern recognition, optimization, and control.

Fuzzy logic is extremely useful for many people involved in research and development including engineers (electrical, mechanical, civil, chemical, aerospace, agricultural, biomedical, computer, environmental, geological, industrial, and mechatronics), mathematicians, computer software developers and researchers, natural scientists (biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics), medical researchers, social scientists (economics, management, political science, and psychology), public policy analysts, business analysts, and jurists.
